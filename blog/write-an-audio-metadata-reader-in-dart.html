      <h1>Write an audio metadata reader in Dart</h1>

      <hr class="mb-8" />

      <p>
        A while ago, I tried to build my own music player. Flutter is great for
        this use case because of its multiplatform capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        What do we need to build a good music player? A library to read audio
        metadata. The metadata is information about the artist's name, the
        album's name, the track number, the length, the release year, the cover
        image... Tons of very useful information we must display to the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my journey, I searched for a suitable library that met my needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's start with <code class="code">metadata_god</code>. This library
        serves as a bridge to the Rust library
        <code class="code">lofty-rs</code>. It functions reasonably well but
        does not provide all the metadata I required. I attempted to fork the
        repository and submit a pull request (PR) to address the issue. However,
        fixing the problem required me to learn Rust, comprehend the
        <code class="code">lofty-rs</code> library (which is rather complex),
        submit my PR, wait for its approval and merging, then submit another PR
        to <code class="code">metadata_god</code> and wait again. Additionally,
        the <code class="code">flutter_rust_bridge</code> only works for Flutter
        apps, not for simple Dart CLI apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I tried to parse my music folder (3000 tracks, 29GB), the libraries
        couldn't parse some tracks:
      </p>
      <pre><code>[ERROR:flutter/runtime/dart_vm_initializer.cc(41)] Unhandled Exception: Instance of 'FrbAnyhowException'</code></pre>

      <p>
        If I wrapped the <code class="code">readMetadata</code> function with a
        try/catch, I caught 87 errors and it took <b>2.3s</b> to read all the
        metadata and keep the cover data in memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other library I investigated is called
        <code class="code">flutter_media_metadata</code>. It serves as a bridge
        between Flutter and a C++ library. For some obscure reasons, the library
        doesn't work anymore on my Linux system. When I tried it, it was slow...
        very slow. I'm using an app called
        <code class="code">Harmonoid</code> that implements this library and it
        took <b>44s</b> to index my folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these libraries are essentially bridges with another library but we
        lack a native Dart library. So why not develop a Dart library to read
        audio metadata? Reading metadata is IO-bound and Dart performs well in
        such scenarios. Additionally, I recall that a
        <code class="code">flutter_rust_bridge</code> library weighs at least
        <b>3MB</b> so developping a native Dart library could potentially reduce
        the app size.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's now delve into the marvelous world of audio containers and binary
        formats! This article serves more as an introduction to audio metadata
        readers, where we'll only scratch the surface of the specifications of
        audio metadata, rather than being a comprehensive Dart/Flutter tutorial.
      </p>

      <h2>ID3 tag</h2>

      <p>
        ID3 is the metadata format used by <code class="code">mp3</code> and
        other audio formats. 4 versions are used : <code class="code">v1</code>
        <code class="code">v2</code> <code class="code">v3</code>
        <code class="code">v4</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        First, we read the 10 first bytes of the file. The 3 first bytes must be
        equal to <code class="code">ID3</code>. With this information, we will
        disregard the file extension entirely and focus solely on the bytes.
        Bytes 4 and 5 indicate the major and minor version of the ID3 tag, while
        the remaining bytes represent the size of the content of the ID3 tag.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, we can parse the frames. Each frame consists of a header and its
        content. The header contains an "ID" that informs us about the type of
        content it represents, such as the album's name, the length of the
        content, and some flags. We continue reading frames until we reach the
        end of the content.
      </p>

      <p>
        The frame ID consists of 4 bytes. We utilize a switch statement to
        extract the information based on the frame ID. For example, TALB
        represents the album's name, TBPM represents the BPM, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        The duration of the track is not always written in the metadata;
        therefore, we have to calculate it. To do this, we need to read the
        first MP3 frame, extract the bitrate and the frequency, and then use a
        simple formula to calculate the duration.
      </p>

      <h2>MP4 metadata</h2>

      <p>
        First, to verify that the file uses MP4 metadata, the 4 first bytes must
        be equal to <code class="code">ftyp</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This format can be a bit complex. It's composed of nested boxes that
        provide information about various aspects such as audio bitrate, video
        bitrate, and so on.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <fieldset class="border border-solid border-gray-300 p-3">
        <legend>box 1</legend>

        <fieldset class="border border-solid border-gray-300 p-3">
          <legend>box 2</legend>

          <fieldset class="border border-solid border-gray-300 p-3">
            <legend>box 3</legend>
            <ul>
              <li>artist</li>
              <li>album</li>
              <li>disc</li>
            </ul>
          </fieldset>
        </fieldset>
      </fieldset>
      <p class="italic text-center">The nested boxes</p>

      <p>
        The strategy involves reading the header of a box, which contains
        information about the box name and its size. MP4 metadata consists of a
        list of predefined boxes that we can utilize. We navigate through these
        boxes until we encounter a box with a name starting with
        <code class="code">Â©</code>. There are a few of them, each defining
        specific information.
      </p>

      <p>
        The box <code class="code">mvhd</code> contains the bitrate and the
        frequency, allowing us to compute the track's duration once again.
      </p>

      <h2>Vorbis Comment</h2>

      <p>
        This one is straightforward. I will only handle
        <code class="code">flac</code>, but the code structure is nearly
        identical for ogg, vorbis, and opus formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flac file consists of blocks, each identified by an ID between 0 and
        127. IDs between 0 and 6 hold special significance. We will read blocks
        with IDs 0 (streaminfo), 4 (vorbis comment), and 6 (picture).
      </p>

      <p>
        From block 0, we will extract the samplerate, bits per sample, and the
        total samples in the stream. Now, the formula
        <code class="code">totalSamplesInStream / sampleRate * 1000</code>
        provides us with the duration of the track.
      </p>

      <p>
        Block 4 contains the current metadata. In comparison with ID3, there
        isn't as much information. All the information is defined in the
        specifications of the Vorbis Comments. They are structured like this:
        <code>ARTIST=ACDC</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Block 6 contains the data for one picture. We can determine whether the
        picture is the front or back cover of the album, and it's possible to
        have more than one picture.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        First, I've learned that implementing these metadata readers is
        challenging not because the code to write is complex, but because the
        documentation is difficult to find, not freely accessible, or not
        sufficiently clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that the library is complete and ready to crawl my music folder, I
        run the code and... it's very fast. It only needs <b>0.9s</b> to parse
        all my tracks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The compressed package size is only <b>30kb</b>. It means that after the
        compilation, we would probably have something smaller. On the other
        side, <code>MetadataGod</code> adds a <code>.so</code> file of
        <b>6MB</b> on Linux, and the Android apk is <b>2.7MB</b> bigger.
      </p>

      <p>
        It shows that it can be worth to write IO-bound libraries in Dart
        instead of using a bridge to a C++/Rust library. It makes the
        maintenance by the Dart/Flutter easier and faster. And because the code
        is pure Dart, we have guarantee that it will work the same for every
        platform!
      </p>

      <p>
        If I add to emit a critique about my current library, I'd say it's
        incomplete. We can only read metadata, not write or edit them. I don't
        think it would be very hard to implement, just annoying because it would
        need to recompute all the <code>length</code> fields for every format.
