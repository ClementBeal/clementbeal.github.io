      <title>Write An Application With Getx</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote an article where I analyzed the source code of GetX. I found many things for which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally use GetX in any of my projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, in my Reddit post, some people said I was wrong; they were more productive and delivering faster, etc. They argued that because I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it, I can&amp;rsquo;t judge, and my opinion is useless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a small project with version &lt;code&gt;^5.0.0-release-candidate-9.2.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Humble Opinion About Getx</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GetX is the first package on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pub.dev&#34;&gt;pub.dev&lt;/a&gt; when sorted by most likes. It has more than 14,000 likes and more than 10,000 stars on GitHub. However, most of the Flutter community will say that it&amp;rsquo;s a very bad package and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if it was true or not. Maybe all the community is wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s the reason I cloned the GetX repo to understand the code and find out what&amp;rsquo;s bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I automate my video creation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was thinking about starting a YouTube channel. I wanted to share my knowledge about Python and Flutter. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert, but I think I can have something to share.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is I&amp;rsquo;m very lazy. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to make videos, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend hours writing a script, recording my voice, editing the video, etc&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to do all that stuff, and neither want to learn 4 new software programs. I made my decision: I&amp;rsquo;m going to let the machine do most of the job for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The journey of writing a new package</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I was looking for a way of displaying a map of the world in my app and be able to select a country on the map. Surprisingly, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found one meeting my needs (I haven&amp;rsquo;t searched a lot though).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the packages giving you the opportunity to draw a map are packages using third parties like &lt;code&gt;Google Maps&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;OpenStreetMap/Leaflet&lt;/code&gt;. They are powerful solutions but you will need to pay to render the map and what&amp;rsquo;s more, it cannot select a special area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Write an audio metadata reader in Dart</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I tried to build my own music player. Flutter is great for this use case because of its multiplatform capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do we need to build a good music player? A library to read audio metadata. The metadata is information about the artist&amp;rsquo;s name, the album&amp;rsquo;s name, the track number, the length, the release year, the cover image&amp;hellip; Tons of very useful information we must display to the user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimize a Flutter web build</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was working on porting my Flutter app to the web. It&amp;rsquo;s a very straightforward operation. I just needed to add the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; platform, build, and done! Then, I remembered that a lot of people were complaining about Flutter&amp;rsquo;s web build. The main complaint is that the app (or web app) has to download a huge JavaScript file the first time a user loads the app. This JavaScript file &lt;code&gt;main.dart.js&lt;/code&gt; weighs 2.5MB at least!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
