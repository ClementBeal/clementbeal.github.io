A few weeks ago, I&rsquo;ve started to work on a plotting library in Flutter. The few available packages to draw plots are only rendering simple plots like a line plot, pie plot or a bar plot.
If you have used before Javascript or Python, you probably know plotly and matplotlib. Those are powerful libraries with which we can render complex charts, charts scientists can use.">

<p>A few weeks ago, I&rsquo;ve started to work on a plotting library in Flutter. The few available packages to draw plots are only rendering simple plots like a line plot, pie plot or a bar plot.<br>
If you have used before Javascript or Python, you probably know <code>plotly</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>. Those are powerful libraries with which we can render complex charts, charts scientists can use.</p>
<p>So among all the plots I&rsquo;m adding to my package, I would like to focus on one chart that I find elegant. It&rsquo;s the treemap.
This chart displays hierarchical data in the shape of rectangle. A rectangle has a portion of the canvas area. It&rsquo;s useful to quickly identify the biggest elements of a dataset.</p>
<p>For instance, some softwares are using it to display the hard disk space usage.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start and implement our own treemap plot.</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithm">The algorithm</h2>
<p>We are going to use the <strong>squarify</strong> algorithm.</p>
