Surprisingly, I haven't found one meeting my needs (I haven't searched a lot though).</p><p>Most of the packages giving you the opportunity to draw a map are packages using third parties like<code>Google Maps</code>or<code>OpenStreetMap/Leaflet</code>. They are powerful solutions but you will need to pay to render the map and what's more, it cannot select a special area.</p><p>So I decided to write my own package! The goal of this article is to show to the people what it could be to write a package in Flutter and to show you a way to proceed to build a project. I hope it will give motivations to some of you!</p><h2>The Package</h2><p>I have decided at the first moment that the maps will be stored in<code>svg</code>files. To those who don't know what SVG is, it's a format to design an image with mathematical formulas. It's useful to have lightweight images that can scale without losing information. And what's the well-known package to render<code>svg</code>files in Flutter? It's<code>flutter_svg</code>!</p><p><code>flutter_svg</code>is a good package but it doesn't allow us to select a specific part of the svg. You have a disc and you want to receive an onTap event? You<em>can't</em>. So I started to read the source code. Maybe I can fork the project and add some interaction.</p><p>It seems<code>flutter_svg</code>is not doing so much on its own. It depends on a package called<a href="https://github.com/dnfield/vector_graphics/tree/main">vector_graphics</a>. If I understood correctly,<code>vector_graphics</code>compiles the svg into a binary format that it can read. There's not a lot of documentation explaining the projects. I didn't want to spend too much time understanding a library I may use just once in my life.</p><p>An SVG file is composed of lines, circles, curves... But... Flutter can draw that too! It has the<code>Painter</code>class to draw lines and others on a canvas. There also is an interesting class called<code>Path</code>. It's used to draw a succession of lines but it has a special property. It has the<code>contains(point)</code>method that tells us if a point is inside the path. So if I give the cursor position, I would know what path is selected. It's decided, this is how I will render my map.</p><h3>Write the SVG Parser</h3><p>Before rendering a map, I need to read an SVG. It's not a task very complicated.<code>SVG</code>is an<em>xml</em>file and it contains different<code>&lt;path></code>. A<code>&lt;path></code>is associated with one country/region and contains 2 pieces of information:</p><ul><li><code>id</code>: that's the code of the country/region/area. It's defined by the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO 3166-2</a>standard.</li><li><code>d</code>: succession of lines, curves, circles etc... In short, the information to draw. Let's call that<code>path</code>.</li></ul><p>The path is composed of commands. The commands are the unique letters in lower case (relative coordinates) and upper case (absolute coordinates) m ; l ; h ; v ; z; c and they are followed by several 2D points:<code>M273.73,261.63l-0.55,0.24</code>.
To parse it easily, I added spaces between letters and numbers thanks to the regex<code>(\S)?([mlhvzcMLHVZC])</code>.</p><p>I can split the string and go through all the tokens. Each command will be stored in its own class inherited<code>Point</code>. Then I created a class<code>SvgPath</code>to accept a country code and a list of<code>Point</code>.</p><h3>The SVG Maps</h3><p>I need to download the SVG maps. I have found a website called<a href="https://mapsvg.com/">MapSVG</a>that provides the maps. Great! I don't want to manually download the ~200 SVGs so I wrote a little script. It's basically a web crawler downloading the SVG maps and generating code for an enum I'm going to use with this format:<code>&lt;countryCamelCase>("&lt;filename>")</code></p><h3>The Assets Issue</h3><p>As you may already know, to define assets in Flutter, we need to add that in our<code>pubspec.yaml</code>file:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">flutter:
  assets:
    - res/maps/</code></pre><p>Then, you can call<code>DefaultAssetBundle.of(context).loadString("res/maps/france.svg")</code>to get the content of the SVG file.</p><p>It wasn't working. I've spent hours reading and testing. Should I put the<code>res</code>folder at the root or in the<code>lib</code>folder? Are there additional things to do? Why does it not work?</p><p>If I had read the documentation a bit better, I would have read that we need to add<code>packages/&lt;my package name></code>to my path. That's all. It was the most time-consuming task of the package...</p><h3>Render the Map</h3><p>I have created a Painter called<code>MapPainter</code>. It takes as input a<code>CountryMap</code>, the cursor position, and a map theme. There is not much to do. We define 4 different painters for the selected/non-selected borders and the selected/non-selected background and we start to draw.</p><p>To draw, we read the information contained by the<code>SvgPath</code>, the command objects returned by the parser. Each command has its equivalent in the<code>Canvas</code>class so it's a simple switch.</p><p>To know if a region is selected, we use the<code>Path().contains(point)</code>method. If it's true, we use the painters for the selected ones. There's nothing much to do. Only 80 lines of code.</p><p>To add interaction like zoom in/out and moving the map, I've started to compute myself the scale factor and use an offset. It was working well but it added a lot of complexity and I couldn't zoom in on the cursor position. But there's already a widget that can do that! You may already know it,<code>InteractiveViewer</code>.</p><p>I wrap my<code>CustomPainter</code>with an<code>InteractiveViewer</code>and done. All the interaction features are implemented. The project is ready to be deployed.</p><h2>The License Problem</h2><p>A user on the<code>FlutterDev</code>Discord noticed that I wasn't mentioning the license of MapSVG anywhere in my package. They are using the<code>CC BY 4.0 Deed</code>license meaning that anyone using their resources must create them, add a link to the license and indicate if changes were made.</p><p>I've simply added credits to them into my ReadMe. I hope it's enough. The users may use the<code>LicenseRegistry</code>to directly add their licenses.</p><h2>What Could Be Added in the Future</h2><p>I want to add markers using latitude and longitude. It would give us the opportunity to build some interesting projects:</p><ul><li>Users could pin and save their current localization on a map</li><li>It could be used to use simple<a href="https://www.flightradar24.com">flightradar24.com</a>. You won't have to worry about the Google Maps cost.</li><li>You have several shops in your country? Put them on the map and add interaction on the markers</li></ul><p>I'd like to add a way to draw different layers of markers. The idea I have in mind is let's say I want to build an app to track the position of my train, I'd like to see the train line and the different cities where it makes a stop. The need of layers is to indicate the Z coordinates of the markers.</p><p>Instead of filling the regions with a color, I could use an image. It's used by some people to build interesting charts.</p><hr/><p>Thank you all for reading this post! I hope it gave ideas to some of you!</p><p>This package wasn't really a complex project. I only needed 3 days to finish it. I don't think the code quality is so good but it should be enough to be understandable.</p><p>Feel free to contribute to this package, you can create an issue and say what you would like.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ClementBeal/interactive_country_map">Github repo</a><br/><a href="https://pub.dev/packages/interactive_country_map">Pub page</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/clementbdev">My Twitter</a></p></div></main></body></html>
