    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>A few days ago, I was looking for a way of displaying a map of the world in my app and be able to select a country on the map. Surprisingly, I haven&rsquo;t found one meeting my needs (I haven&rsquo;t searched a lot though).</p>
<p>Most of the packages giving you the opportunity to draw a map are packages using third parties like <code>Google Maps</code> or <code>OpenStreetMap/Leaflet</code>. They are powerful solutions but you will need to pay to render the map and what&rsquo;s more, it cannot select a special area.</p>
<p>So I decided to write my own package! The goal of this article is to show to the people what it could be to write a package in Flutter and to show you a way to proceed to build a project. I hope it will give motivations to some of you!</p>
<h2 id="the-package">The Package</h2>
<p>I have decided at the first moment that the maps will be stored in <code>svg</code> files. To those who don&rsquo;t know what SVG is, it&rsquo;s a format to design an image with mathematical formulas. It&rsquo;s useful to have lightweight images that can scale without losing information. And what&rsquo;s the well-known package to render <code>svg</code> files in Flutter? It&rsquo;s <code>flutter_svg</code>!</p>
<p><code>flutter_svg</code> is a good package but it doesn&rsquo;t allow us to select a specific part of the svg. You have a disc and you want to receive an onTap event? You <em>can&rsquo;t</em>. So I started to read the source code. Maybe I can fork the project and add some interaction.</p>
<p>It seems <code>flutter_svg</code> is not doing so much on its own. It depends on a package called <a href="https://github.com/dnfield/vector_graphics/tree/main">vector_graphics</a>. If I understood correctly, <code>vector_graphics</code> compiles the svg into a binary format that it can read. There&rsquo;s not a lot of documentation explaining the projects. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend too much time understanding a library I may use just once in my life.</p>
<p>An SVG file is composed of lines, circles, curves&hellip; But&hellip; Flutter can draw that too! It has the <code>Painter</code> class to draw lines and others on a canvas. There also is an interesting class called <code>Path</code>. It&rsquo;s used to draw a succession of lines but it has a special property. It has the <code>contains(point)</code> method that tells us if a point is inside the path. So if I give the cursor position, I would know what path is selected. It&rsquo;s decided, this is how I will render my map.</p>
<h3 id="write-the-svg-parser">Write the SVG Parser</h3>
<p>Before rendering a map, I need to read an SVG. It&rsquo;s not a task very complicated. <code>SVG</code> is an <em>xml</em> file and it contains different <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>. A <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> is associated with one country/region and contains 2 pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: that&rsquo;s the code of the country/region/area. It&rsquo;s defined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO 3166-2</a> standard.</li>
<li><code>d</code>: succession of lines, curves, circles etc&hellip; In short, the information to draw. Let&rsquo;s call that <code>path</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The path is composed of commands. The commands are the unique letters in lower case (relative coordinates) and upper case (absolute coordinates) m ; l ; h ; v ; z; c and they are followed by several 2D points: <code>M273.73,261.63l-0.55,0.24</code>.
To parse it easily, I added spaces between letters and numbers thanks to the regex <code>(\S)?([mlhvzcMLHVZC])</code>.</p>
<p>I can split the string and go through all the tokens. Each command will be stored in its own class inherited <code>Point</code>. Then I created a class <code>SvgPath</code> to accept a country code and a list of <code>Point</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-svg-maps">The SVG Maps</h3>
<p>I need to download the SVG maps. I have found a website called <a href="https://mapsvg.com/">MapSVG</a> that provides the maps. Great! I don&rsquo;t want to manually download the ~200 SVGs so I wrote a little script. It&rsquo;s basically a web crawler downloading the SVG maps and generating code for an enum I&rsquo;m going to use with this format: <code>&lt;countryCamelCase&gt;(&quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot;)</code></p>
<h3 id="the-assets-issue">The Assets Issue</h3>
<p>As you may already know, to define assets in Flutter, we need to add that in our <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">flutter</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#f92672">assets</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    - <span style="color:#ae81ff">res/maps/</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, you can call <code>DefaultAssetBundle.of(context).loadString(&quot;res/maps/france.svg&quot;)</code> to get the content of the SVG file.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t working. I&rsquo;ve spent hours reading and testing. Should I put the <code>res</code> folder at the root or in the <code>lib</code> folder? Are there additional things to do? Why does it not work?</p>
<p>If I had read the documentation a bit better, I would have read that we need to add <code>packages/&lt;my package name&gt;</code> to my path. That&rsquo;s all. It was the most time-consuming task of the package&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="render-the-map">Render the Map</h3>
<p>I have created a Painter called <code>MapPainter</code>. It takes as input a <code>CountryMap</code>, the cursor position, and a map theme. There is not much to do. We define 4 different painters for the selected/non-selected borders and the selected/non-selected background and we start to draw.</p>
<p>To draw, we read the information contained by the <code>SvgPath</code>, the command objects returned by the parser. Each command has its equivalent in the <code>Canvas</code> class so it&rsquo;s a simple switch.</p>
<p>To know if a region is selected, we use the <code>Path().contains(point)</code> method. If it&rsquo;s true, we use the painters for the selected ones. There&rsquo;s nothing much to do. Only 80 lines of code.</p>
<p>To add interaction like zoom in/out and moving the map, I&rsquo;ve started to compute myself the scale factor and use an offset. It was working well but it added a lot of complexity and I couldn&rsquo;t zoom in on the cursor position. But there&rsquo;s already a widget that can do that! You may already know it, <code>InteractiveViewer</code>.</p>
<p>I wrap my <code>CustomPainter</code> with an <code>InteractiveViewer</code> and done. All the interaction features are implemented. The project is ready to be deployed.</p>
<h2 id="the-license-problem">The License Problem</h2>
<p>A user on the <code>FlutterDev</code> Discord noticed that I wasn&rsquo;t mentioning the license of MapSVG anywhere in my package. They are using the <code>CC BY 4.0 Deed</code> license meaning that anyone using their resources must create them, add a link to the license and indicate if changes were made.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve simply added credits to them into my ReadMe. I hope it&rsquo;s enough. The users may use the <code>LicenseRegistry</code> to directly add their licenses.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-be-added-in-the-future">What Could Be Added in the Future</h2>
<p>I want to add markers using latitude and longitude. It would give us the opportunity to build some interesting projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users could pin and save their current localization on a map</li>
<li>It could be used to use simple <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com">flightradar24.com</a>. You won&rsquo;t have to worry about the Google Maps cost.</li>
<li>You have several shops in your country? Put them on the map and add interaction on the markers</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to add a way to draw different layers of markers. The idea I have in mind is let&rsquo;s say I want to build an app to track the position of my train, I&rsquo;d like to see the train line and the different cities where it makes a stop. The need of layers is to indicate the Z coordinates of the markers.</p>
<p>Instead of filling the regions with a color, I could use an image. It&rsquo;s used by some people to build interesting charts.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you all for reading this post! I hope it gave ideas to some of you!</p>
<p>This package wasn&rsquo;t really a complex project. I only needed 3 days to finish it. I don&rsquo;t think the code quality is so good but it should be enough to be understandable.</p>
<p>Feel free to contribute to this package, you can create an issue and say what you would like.</p>
